Features:
One extra feature that I have implemented is the ability to select multiple shapes and move them as a unit.

Sample code was taken from CS349 lectures "07.widgets", "08.events", and "09.graphics" in the examples.
Many ideas of code were also taken from https://docs.oracle.com, which is an open source website.
